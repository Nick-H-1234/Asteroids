Welcome to Asteroids!

GAMEPLAY:
You are in control of a small ship, and need to survive for as long as possible.
Asteroids will spawn in waves of increasing difficulty. 
Destroying all asteroids in one wave will spawn the next.
Larger asteroids will break into smaller ones when destroyed.
Points are earned by destroying asteroids and surviving waves.
You will lose a life if your ship crashes into an asteroid, and you'll be able to respawn a few seconds later.
When respawning, you get a few seconds of invulnerability - indicated by the yellow bar - which allows you to destroy asteroids by touching them.
The game ends when you lose all three lives, or can be restarted at any time by pressing "R".
